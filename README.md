# Repository name: "mri_sort_filter_convert"

## Purpose:
To document the process of sorting, filtering and converting files.
This repository's contribution is such that it provides a filter for removing data deemed unnecessary to convert to NIFTI as that process in itself is time consuming.

## How to run successfully:
The steps:
- 1: Use "dicom_sort.py" (from: <<insert github URL>>) on the raw and extracted MR data.
- 2: Use "filter.py" on the sorted data.
  -- Remember to specify the correct paths.
- 3: Use a DICOM to NIFTI converter.

As of now the series that are kept after the filtration algorithm is run are:
- T1
- T2 FLAIR
- SWI
- TOF

## Regarding reusability:
The algorithms may as well only be applicable to (our) TOS7 MRI data, as it is only tested on these data. This narrow applicability could be due to unique or local scanner naming convention paired with the "dicom_sort.py" algorithm.

Finally, the data should be sorted similarly to BIDS (http://bids.neuroimaging.io/) with a structure as:
".../study/subject_ID/series_X/*.dcm"

If the files are structured as illustrated, then it this "filter.py" should be usable if the identification "keys" are renamed to match the local naming convention.
